### Week 1
No work on the repository.

### Week 2
For F9, we added an automated workflow that trains the SMS classifier and publishes the model artifacts as versioned GitHub Releases. For F10, the model-service was updated to load its model externally, downloading it at startup if missing and caching it in a mounted directory.
